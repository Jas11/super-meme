Many sites on the net uses past user data to mage changes on what to show to the said user in the future. While some of them use future prediction to show relevant ads, others are more concerned with making the user stick to the same platform. social media sites like instagram, reddit, zhihu (a chinese quora?), and news sites across the world predict the content users are interested in by their viewing history. But I question the effectiveness of this algorithm in the long term. I think one of the primary reason many people go on platforms like these are to access new information. I used to spend a lot of time on Zhihu when I was in high school. but gradually I became aware that all the post i see on the "discover" page are on the same few topics, and they are usually very stuffed with emotions (as radical and agitating content attract most eyeballs on media). And that's when i felt that scrolling through this site is a complete waste of time. same with instagram, the recommended content always becomes whatt catches the most eyeballs. Now i rarely go on these sites in the hope of finding any new perspectve or useful content. I mostly go to the bookstore or other physical places to discover newe things to look into and only go on those sites if i have a specific question. It also raises the question of how these algorithms are chainging what's endorsed by the medium. if those algorithms doesn't exist, would i be the same things that catch most attention? I think on instagram, its really important to capture the attention of new users. It might not be what they are neccessarily interested in at first, maybe they are just curious. But gradually the algorithm would narrow the scope of things they see and then it defines the particular user's perception of the internet.
