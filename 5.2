I don't agree with his claims. I think that any space without rules would result in chaos. I think Barlow really imagined the internet to be like a round table of communications. He wanted a solution to many persisting problems of the reality, like inequality of race and status, which is not bad by itself. But he did not have a specific vision as to how to produce something with value through the internet space.
I think nowadays our internet selves are very much an extension of our physical selves. Some of the online services are very reliant on the personal information of their users. Banks, payment apps, and government service apps definitly requires ID information. All social media accounts in China have to be linked to a national ID both for security and prevention of cyber-violence reasons and for law enforcement. Also net neutrality is greatly interfered by the government. Certain Chinese and Japanese websites are very hard to load in the us. Most western social media platforms are completely banned in China. Internet is really just an extension for the soverenty of countries. Also as states controlls all the internet provided inside their broaders and IP addresses can be tracked through traces of communication on the web, freedom of speech online can lead to physical coersion. People can be silenced by the expropriation of internet access. Additionally, AI algorisms make it really hard for people to access information different to what they are used to. While Barlow theoretically imagined the internet space to be somewhere people can be exposed to the most diverse range of information, but the scope of info we can see is more limited than ever.
