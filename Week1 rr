People would often agree that physical strength and skills are acquired through practice, but regards mental skills, such as writing, as ones that can be acquired immediately. The writer of this article suggests that writing not only takes practice, but also requires a professional editor. The author talks a lot about the beginning pages of the books he see, and mentions multiple times how many titles and first lines lack the elements to attract the readers' attention. I think the mistakes he mentions is especially important to avoid when posting on social media where each post only get less than 200 words to appeal to the audience. Also, sometimes social media gives us a less professional and biased "mommy" feedback about our writing; less carefully written books gain prevalence because they are fast to produce and easy to read; being constantly exposed in such an environment prevents us from further practicing storytelling and appealing to a greater audience.
