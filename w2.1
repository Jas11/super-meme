My most favorite work is We Become What We Behold. I think that the game gives no other instructions other than to take pictures amplifies the effect of the game. To let the players discover the rules of drawing attention with media make the ending feel like it's controlled by personal choice. It also recreates the process how imfuencial people on mass media decide what to publish, so that players are aware that what everyone believe in is not neccessarily true. I think the statement this game makes is especailly important in our era because everyone agrees that peace is good, but violence is encouraged by the media. This is different from the general sentiment of hatred in ancient and classical times, when information is rare and unity against other regimes is crucial to survival. We now have the ability to represent the truth exactly as it is and we have the tools to ensure an average life for everyone. It's important for artists to make art that educate the public to realize the landmark events that can be used to manipulate the public, even if the manupulators are not aware of it, and to realize the unneccesary things we keep doing to spread hate.
