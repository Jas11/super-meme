I want to make art that builds on chinese philosophical concepts and aesthetics. I'm inspired by all types of visual and audio media, from films to fashion. I love artworks that accentuates the existence by contrasting it with nothingness. I like aesthetics related to rituals, mysticism, and primitive passions. I love artworks that convey the concepts of the eternal and the ephemeral. 
I love the works of Ang Lee, Uma Wang, and Tim Yip. They are all Chinese artists whoes work embodies Chinese philosophy and mysticicsm. I love the peculiar forms of Uma Wang and Tim Yip's fashion. Sometimmes Yip's work of fashion and theater has a almost pathological quality. While he takes the patterns and palletts of traditional Chinese art, he exaggerates them and reconstruct them so that they are both sophisticated in aesthetics and also primal and brutal in the feeling they convey. Ang Lee's works has a element of obscurity essential to the Chinese persona. He uses iintricate shots of details to convey emotions or hidden storylines. The Chinese believe that while artworks  can be flamboyant and crude, their meaning should never be too explicit. Emotions should be felt in actions or words that does not address emotions.
Artworks are deeply rooted in the heritage and philosophy of the artist. Diaz's statement about smuggling poems from prisons and painting the walls confining them really resonate with me. Because I think a work of art inevitably makes statements about what the artist believes in. To not give up on making original art is to not give up on insisting the identity of oneself
