I went to Blackbird Gallery and saw Embodiments by Ben Snell. When i saw the AI-created sculptures, it instantly reminds me of the form of classical greek sculptures. In nearly every one of them the head is recognizable. Some have a very stable triangular shape that's common in classical sculptures. The circular robot drawings are also interesting. They are definitly aesthetically pleasing. The lady at the gallery told me that the artist call them fingerprints of an robot but he made those robots by hand himself. It made me think about if the fingerprints of the robot are fingerprints of the artist too. I text the artist on instagram and asked him if he trained the sculpture-making ai with images of well preserved sculptures or with the brocken ones. Because I thought that some sculptures look like complete human beings while others seem to be missing some parts. He told me that there was a mix of brocken ones and well preserved ones. The sculpture series seems to fit well into a discussion about which elements of a sculpture make it recognizable as coming from a certain era or catagorized in a certain collection.
